dunghd: Create a new Python project that use poetry for creating simple ETL Pipeline: Build a small-scale ETL pipeline. Extract data from a CSV file, transform it using Pandas, and load it into a local SQLite database.

GitHub Copilot: I'll help you create a Python project with Poetry for a simple ETL pipeline. Let me start by setting up the project structure and configuration.

Generating plan to create a new workspace

Let me create the project structure and set up the Python ETL pipeline project with Poetry.

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/.github)

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/.github/copilot-instructions.md)

Now let me get the project setup information for a Python project:

Getting setup information

Let me create the project structure manually. First, I'll initialize a Poetry project:

Ran terminal command: poetry init --name etl-pipeline --version 0.1.0 --description "Simple ETL Pipeline using Pandas and SQLite" --author "Developer" --python "^3.8" --dependency pandas --dependency sqlite3 --no-interaction

Ran terminal command: poetry init

Let me create a proper pyproject.toml file manually:

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/pyproject.toml)

Let me check the current pyproject.toml and fix it:

Read [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/pyproject.toml)

I need to replace this with a proper Poetry configuration:

Using "Replace String in File"

```

```

Now let me create the project structure:

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/etl_pipeline)

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/data)

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/tests)

Let me create the ETL pipeline components:

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/etl_pipeline/__init__.py)

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/etl_pipeline/extract.py)

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/etl_pipeline/transform.py)

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/etl_pipeline/load.py)

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/etl_pipeline/main.py)

Now let me create test files:

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/tests/test_etl_pipeline.py)

Let me create the **init**.py file for tests:

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/tests/__init__.py)

Now let me create a README file:

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/README.md)

Let me update the project status in the copilot instructions:

Using "Replace String in File"

```

```

Now let me install the Python extension and compile the project:

Python extension is already installed

Now let me install the dependencies using Poetry:

Ran terminal command: poetry install

Now let me create and run a task for the ETL pipeline:

`Run ETL Pipeline` task finished

Let me check the task output:

`Run ETL Pipeline` task finished

Let me try running the ETL pipeline directly:

Continue to iterate?
[object Object]

Made changes.

dunghd: @agent Continue: "Continue to iterate?"

GitHub Copilot: Ran terminal command: poetry run python -m etl_pipeline.main

Excellent! The ETL pipeline is working successfully. Let me run the tests to verify everything is working properly:

Ran terminal command: poetry run pytest -v

Great! All tests are passing. Let me fix the pandas warning by updating the transform.py file:

Using "Replace String in File"

```

```

Now let me update the copilot instructions to mark the remaining steps as complete:

Using "Replace String in File"

```

```

Perfect! I've successfully created a complete Python ETL pipeline project using Poetry. Here's what has been implemented:

## Project Summary

✅ **Complete ETL Pipeline** with the following components:

- **Extract**: `CSVExtractor` class that reads and validates CSV files
- **Transform**: `DataTransformer` class with data cleaning, filtering, aggregation, and calculated columns
- **Load**: `SQLiteLoader` class that stores data in SQLite database with error handling
- **Main Pipeline**: `ETLPipeline` orchestrator that coordinates all phases

✅ **Key Features**:

- Modular design with separate modules for each ETL phase
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Flexible configuration options
- Sample data generation for testing
- Context managers for proper resource management
- Data validation and verification

✅ **Project Structure**:

- Poetry configuration with proper dependencies (pandas, pytest, black, flake8)
- Organized package structure with etl_pipeline module
- Complete test suite with 9 passing tests
- Comprehensive documentation in README.md
- Sample data directory with auto-generated test data

✅ **Working Pipeline**:

- Successfully processed 103 rows of sample data
- Removed duplicates (reduced to 100 rows)
- Handled missing values properly
- Added calculated columns (id, processed_at timestamp)
- Loaded data into SQLite database
- Verified data integrity

✅ **Testing & Quality**:

- All 9 unit tests passing
- Test coverage for all major components
- Code formatting with Black
- Linting with Flake8
- Fixed pandas warnings for better code quality

## Usage

You can now run the ETL pipeline in several ways:

1. **Quick start**: `poetry run python -m etl_pipeline.main`
2. **Using the script**: `poetry run etl-run`
3. **Programmatically**: Import and configure the pipeline components

The project is ready for further development and can be easily extended with additional data sources, transformations, or destinations. The modular design makes it simple to add new features while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

Made changes.

dunghd: add gitignore for this project

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a project-level `.gitignore` to exclude virtualenvs, caches, build artifacts, IDE files, and local DB files.

Now I'll create the `.gitignore` file with common Python/Poetry entries and project-specific ignores (like the SQLite DB in data). Expected outcome: a new `.gitignore` at the repo root.

Created [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/.gitignore)

Done — I added a project-level .gitignore at the repository root to exclude common Python artifacts, Poetry/virtualenv caches, IDE files, test caches, and local DB/data files (including `data/*.db` and `data/*.sqlite`).

What's next

- If you'd like, I can add an entry to explicitly ignore the generated sample CSV (sample_data.csv) or keep it tracked.
- I can also create a `.gitattributes` file or run a quick git status to show what would be ignored (if you want me to run that, say so).

Made changes.
