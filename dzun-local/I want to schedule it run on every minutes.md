dunghd: I want to schedule it run on every minutes to test

GitHub Copilot: I'll create a short todo list and then open the DAG file to update its schedule to run every minute (CRON "_/1 _ \* \* \*"), set catchup to False, and run the unit tests to validate. I'll mark the first todo as in-progress and then read the DAG file.

Created 4 todos

dunghd: I want to schedule it run on every minutes to test

GitHub Copilot: I'm going to update the DAG to run every minute and set a recent start date; expected outcome: etl_pipeline_dag.py will use CRON "_/1 _ \* \* \*" and a current `start_date`. Then I'll update the todo list and run the unit tests to verify no syntax errors.

Using "Apply Patch"

```

```

I'll mark the DAG change todo as completed and run the tests next. Then I'll update the todo list accordingly.

Starting (3/4) _Run tests_

I'll run the unit tests now to verify the change didn't introduce errors. I expect tests to be quick (they're small project tests). I'll run the test suite.

Running tests...

I'll open test_etl_pipeline.py to see why the test runner didn't find tests, then run the tests in a terminal if needed. Expected outcome: confirm test contents and run them.

Read [](file:///Users/dung.ho/Documents/Training/Python/simple-etl-pipeline-1/tests/test_etl_pipeline.py)

I'll run the test suite with Poetry so it uses the project's environment; expected outcome: pytest runs and shows pass/fail output.

Ran terminal command: poetry run pytest -q

I'll mark the tests todo as completed and then provide instructions for running Airflow scheduler/webserver and verifying the DAG runs every minute.

Starting (4/4) _Give run instructions_

I'll update the DAG to run every minute, verify tests pass, and give concise instructions to run Airflow locally and observe the DAG executing every minute.

## Actions taken

- Updated the DAG schedule in etl_pipeline_dag.py:
  - Replaced `schedule='@daily'` with `schedule='*/1 * * * *'` (run every minute).
  - Set `start_date=datetime(2025, 10, 17)` and left `catchup=False` (so it will start immediately at the next schedule).
- Ran the project's test suite with Poetry:
  - Result: 9 passed in 0.62s

Files changed

- etl_pipeline_dag.py — changed schedule to run every minute and updated start_date for local testing.

## Why this is safe

- Using `catchup=False` prevents Airflow from running all missed past runs.
- The tests passed after the change, confirming no syntax/runtime issues were introduced.

## How to run and observe the DAG executing every minute (local development)

Below are standard steps. Use them in a terminal (zsh). I won't assume how you start Airflow in your environment — these are the typical commands for a local Airflow installation.

1. Make sure Airflow is installed and initialized (if you haven't done so):

```bash
# initialize metadata DB (run once)
airflow db init

# create a user for the web UI (replace values as desired)
airflow users create \
  --username admin \
  --firstname Admin \
  --lastname User \
  --role Admin \
  --email admin@example.com \
  --password admin
```

2. Ensure your Airflow `dags_folder` includes this repository's dags directory. If running Airflow from the project root, the dags folder should already be detected.

3. Start the webserver and scheduler in separate terminals:

Terminal A — webserver:

```bash
# starts the webserver on default port 8080
airflow webserver
```

Terminal B — scheduler:

```bash
airflow scheduler
```

4. Verify the DAG appears in the Airflow UI:

- Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser and log in with the user created above.
- Find `simple_etl_pipeline` in the DAGs list and turn it on if it's off.

5. Watch runs happen every minute:

- With the DAG enabled, you should see new DAG runs scheduled once per minute.
- Visit the DAG’s Graph view or Tree view to inspect task runs.
- Click a task instance to see logs. Logs will show when PythonOperator called `extract_task`, `transform_task`, `load_task`.

6. Optional: Trigger manually (if you prefer immediate run):

```bash
# trigger a manual run
airflow dags trigger simple_etl_pipeline
```

7. To stop the periodic execution, either disable the DAG in the Airflow UI or revert the schedule in etl_pipeline_dag.py (or remove the DAG file from the dags folder).

## Quick verification tips

- Check scheduler logs if runs aren't appearing: the terminal running `airflow scheduler` will show scheduling activity and any errors.
- Task logs (via the web UI or the logs folder) will show output of your ETL functions. For fast local testing, consider adding print/log statements in airflow_tasks.py to confirm execution.

## Next steps / suggestions

- If you'd like, I can:
  - Revert the schedule to `@daily` after tests.
  - Add an environment variable or DAG config to toggle the test-every-minute schedule (so you can switch between testing and production schedules without editing the file).
  - Add a lightweight integration test that uses Airflow's test mode to execute the DAG tasks locally (helpful for CI).

Everything needed to run it every minute is in place. Would you like me to add a toggle (env-var based) so you can switch schedules without editing the DAG file?

Made changes.

dunghd: how can I deloy this change to the local airflow?

GitHub Copilot: I'll add a short todo list for deploying to the local Airflow and mark the first deployment step as in-progress. Then I'll give step-by-step commands and checks you can run locally.

Completed (4/8) _Give run instructions_

I'll walk you through deploying the DAG change to your local Airflow and give exact commands you can run. I'll also include a short checklist you can follow and a few troubleshooting tips.

## Quick checklist (what we'll do)

- Stop any running Airflow processes (scheduler / webserver / api-server) so we can restart cleanly.
- Ensure the modified etl_pipeline_dag.py is saved into the dags folder Airflow reads.
- Start Airflow (scheduler + webserver or use `airflow standalone`).
- Confirm the DAG appears in the UI and observe runs every minute.
- Optionally trigger a manual run or use task-level local testing.

I'll assume you're using Poetry (your workspace shows `poetry` usage) and Airflow is installed in the same Poetry environment. If Airflow is installed system-wide, adapt commands by removing `poetry run`.

## Step-by-step commands (zsh)

1. Stop any running Airflow processes

```bash
# find and kill scheduler, webserver, api-server if running
pkill -f "airflow scheduler" || true
pkill -f "airflow webserver" || true
pkill -f "airflow api-server" || true
```

2. Ensure your DAG file is saved (and optionally commit)

- Save file in your editor. To commit:

```bash
git add dags/etl_pipeline_dag.py
git commit -m "DAG: run every minute for local testing"
```

(Committing is optional but helps if your Airflow instance reads DAGs from a different clone or a deployed folder.)

3. Start Airflow. You have two common options:

Option A — Use Airflow standalone (single command, good for local dev)

```bash
# runs webserver + scheduler + everything in one process (Airflow 2.3+)
poetry run airflow standalone
```

- Pros: easiest to start everything and it shows the webserver URL in the output (usually http://localhost:8080).
- Cons: runs in the foreground; ctrl-C to stop.

Option B — Start scheduler and webserver separately (useful for background runs)
Open two terminals (or use background processes):

Terminal 1 — scheduler:

```bash
poetry run airflow scheduler
```

Terminal 2 — webserver (in foreground):

```bash
poetry run airflow webserver
```

Or run webserver in background:

```bash
poetry run airflow webserver & disown
```

If you prefer the API server (Airflow v2.x), you can start it:

```bash
poetry run airflow api-server
```

4. Confirm the DAG is loaded

- Open http://localhost:8080 and log in (use the admin user you created earlier).
- Find `simple_etl_pipeline` in the list. If it doesn't appear, check the scheduler/webserver logs for errors.

Alternatively, check DAG list from the CLI:

```bash
poetry run airflow dags list
```

5. Enable the DAG (if it's off) and watch runs every minute

- Turn the DAG on in the UI; with schedule '_/1 _ \* \* \*' and `catchup=False` you'll see new runs created every minute.
- Inspect Task logs in the UI or tail the scheduler/webserver logs.

6. Trigger a manual run (optional)

```bash
poetry run airflow dags trigger simple_etl_pipeline
```

7. Test single task locally (without the scheduler) — useful for quick validation

```bash
# Example: run the 'extract' task from a specific DAG run context (execution_date is needed)
poetry run airflow tasks test simple_etl_pipeline extract 2025-10-17T00:00:00
```

- Note: `airflow tasks test` runs the task callable directly in your terminal, isolated from scheduler, and is great for debugging.

## Troubleshooting tips

- DAG not appearing:

  - Check that the `dags_folder` used by Airflow matches your repository dags path (see `airflow config list`).
  - Check webserver or scheduler logs for import errors (syntax or dependency errors).
  - Ensure the project dependencies are available to the Python interpreter Airflow is using (if using Poetry, run Airflow through `poetry run airflow ...`).

- DAG fails at runtime:

  - Inspect task logs via UI or `airflow tasks logs <dag_id> <task_id> <execution_date>`.
  - If tasks need external resources (DB file paths, CSV), ensure the Airflow user/process has access.

- If you want Airflow to automatically pick up code changes:
  - Webserver and scheduler will pick up file changes automatically, but sometimes you need to restart them if Python import caching prevents the new code from loading. Restart the scheduler if needed.

## Next step

You already ran `poetry run airflow scheduler &` and `poetry run airflow api-server` earlier. If those processes are running, check the web UI at http://localhost:8080 to confirm the `simple_etl_pipeline` DAG is present and enabled. If you want, I can:

- Show a short checklist to run now and verify the DAG is executing every minute.
- Add an environment-variable toggle in the DAG to switch between `@daily` and `*/1 * * * *` so you don't have to edit the file again.

Which of the above would you like next?
